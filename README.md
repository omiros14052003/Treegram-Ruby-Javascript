# Treegram-Ruby-Javascript
A little social media web app made on Ruby on Rails framework for the course MYE042 Internet Technologies CSE UOI.

## Exercise parts:
The project is part of two exercises for the course. The part of building the backend and the db in ruby is referenced in lab1.pdf and the additions of javascript for better interactivity are referenced in lab2.pdf. The treegram folder contains all the files that have been used for the second part which is built on part 1.

## Running the app:
The exercise was required to be developed in a specific virtual machine made for the course, so running the files might not be possible to any machine that hasn't been properly seted up
